# Maillist-Landing-Page-
heroku app: https://young-journey-76314.herokuapp.com

![Mailchim Logo](https://colorlib.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/email-subscription-plugins.jpg)

Simple mailing list collection landing page, built by inetegrating mailchip API with Node.js.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: Mailchimp


Note: App is uploaded and running on heroku (https://young-journey-76314.herokuapp.com/); 
Hence, Mailchimp API key is blocked and app won't submit form upon filling. 

On forking, please change the API authurization to yours in app.js file line 44 to yours, to integrate and personalise.
All other functions and blocks are running smoothly, as expected from the app design.


Feel free to fork and make pull requests.

Thanks!
